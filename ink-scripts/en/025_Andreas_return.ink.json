Back then, many years ago, Constantine and I entered one of the rooms of that labyrinth. I remember he moved an object and the door began to close. It was my luck that I brought a crowbar with me, which I was able to use to jam the closing door. While crawling under the granite block, I heardthe sound of metal grinding over the rock. The crowbar could have shot out at any moment. I had never felt such fear in my life. Do you understand? The trap worked after so many years. Exploring that labyrinth is extremely risky.
