	Xenia, is there a myth about Eris?	# actor:player
	Eris is a goddess of strife. She was the one to stealthily place an apple inscribed with "callisti", which means "for the most beautiful", before Hera, the supreme goddess, Aphrodite, the goddess of the beauty, and Athena, the goddess of the fair war. The goddesses started to dispute to whom this apple was addressed.	# actor:female

	Max, any ideas?	# actor:player
	These things with statues can be rotated, so we need to put them in their proper positions. Then the apple button should work. This system reminds me of a code lock on a suitcase. Usually when a part of a mechanism gets to its proper place there will be a clicking sound. Rotate that statue once again.	# actor:bandit
