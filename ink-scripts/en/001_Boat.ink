Where is the boat?	# actor:player

I don't know. You probably forgot to tie it up and the tide swept it out to the sea. Why have you returned so soon? Did you believe that I would take the boat and leave you here?	# actor:female
To make sure you found the boat.	# actor:player
I see. It's a pity the boat is gone.	# actor:female
Ok, I need to check something out. Stay here; I'll be back in a couple of hours, and then we'll wait for the ferry together.	# actor:player
Great, now I'll have to stand on the beach without even a stump to sit on.	# actor:female
