I see. How did you find out about this maze?	# actor:bandit
From my father. And you?	# actor:player
The same. He found this maze when he was young and then invited your father to join him as a specialist on ancient Greece. But they decided that it was too dangerous to study this place.	# actor:bandit
Yes, I heard that story too.	# actor:player
But we are not so easily scared! We're still going forward, right?	# actor:bandit
Right.	# actor:player
