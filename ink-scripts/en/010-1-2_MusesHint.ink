		I think these are statues of muses. There are twelve muses, but there's only three of them here. The patroness of theater — Melpomene, astronomy — Urania, and history — Clio. I don't remember exactly how they are usually depicted, but I think they are standing on the wrong pedestals here.	# actor:female
