Andreas, aren't you going to criticize me?	# actor:female
Do you want me to?	# actor:player
No, but it was my mistake grabbing the statue.	# actor:female
I would have taken it eventually anyway. But first I would study the room and everything inside.	# actor:player
If you are done flirting with each other , maybe we should think what to do next? Are we taking another statue from the pedestal and activating another trap?	# actor:bandit
We don't know for sure what is going to happen.	# actor:player
We should just take the statue then.	# actor:bandit
Xenia, can you tell us anything about this statue?	# actor:player
According to its attributes, this should be Hermes, the god of trade. I could tell you a lot about him, but I'm not sure which legend could prove useful right now. If you're done looking around the room, let's try to take the statue.	# actor:female
