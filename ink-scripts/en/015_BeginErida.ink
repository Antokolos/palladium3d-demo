There's a new statue here. This is Eris. If we take it, another trap will probably be triggered.	# actor:female # voiceover:556_there's_a_new_statue_here.ogg
That is possible.	# actor:player # voiceover:480_that_is_possible.ogg
Andreas, there are human skeletons here. I wonder who are they and what killed them. Maybe the trap?	# actor:female # voiceover:557_Andreas_there_are_human_skeletons.ogg
These are conquistadors according to their armor. I doubt it was a trap that killed them â€” the statue is still on its post.	# actor:player # voiceover:481_these_are_conquistadors.ogg
Maybe they took the statue and then put it back, hoping the door would open.	# actor:female # voiceover:558_maybe_they_took_the_statue.ogg
That is possible.	# actor:player # voiceover:482_that_is_possible.ogg
Or they died elsewhere and somebody brought their bodies here to scare off adventurers like us.	# actor:female # voiceover:559_or_they_died_elsewhere.ogg
That is possible, too.	# actor:player # voiceover:483_that_is_possible_too.ogg
This room has a strange, faint smell. A little sweet, but unpleasant. Can you smell it?	# actor:female # voiceover:564_this_room_has_a_strange.ogg
No.	# actor:player # voiceover:484_no.ogg
