There's a new statue here. This is Eris. If we take it, another trap will probably be triggered.	# actor:female
That is possible.	# actor:player
Andreas, there are human skeletons here. I wonder who are they and what killed them. Maybe the trap?	# actor:female
These are conquistadors according to their armor. I doubt it was a trap that killed them â€” the statue is still on its post.	# actor:player
Maybe they took the statue and then put it back, hoping the door would open.	# actor:female
That is possible.	# actor:player
Or they died elsewhere and somebody brought their bodies here to scare off adventurers like us.	# actor:female
That is possible, too.	# actor:player
This room has a strange, faint smell. A little sweet, but unpleasant. Can you smell it?	# actor:female
No.	# actor:player
