I don't think so.	# actor:player # voiceover:492_i_don't_think_so.ogg
Why not?	# actor:female # voiceover:572_why_not.ogg
Technically that's a more difficult task. And it is less likely that we'll activate a trap in the corridor.	# actor:player # voiceover:493_technically_that_is_a_more_difficult.ogg
