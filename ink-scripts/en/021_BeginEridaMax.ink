Wow, skeletons! According to their armor, they have been lying here for a long time. I wonder what they killed each other for? Was there something more precious than this statue on the pedestal?	# actor:bandit
No, I doubt that. If there's gold around here, it should be stored in some special room.	# actor:player
Maybe, anticipating great loot, they started fighting before even finding anything of value. Yet they became a feast for the local rats.	# actor:bandit
We need to take the statue. The trap might get triggered; are you ready?	# actor:player
Yes. I wish I knew what to be ready for.	# actor:bandit
